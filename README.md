# chiller
Glycol chiller using 5k BTU AC unit. 120VAC pump in a cooler turns on when a fermentor demands cooling. Each fermentor has a 12vdc ball
valve to control flow. DS18B20 temperature sensors are used for coolant temperature, fermentation vessel (FV) temperature, and ambient
temperature. PID setpoint temperatures are set using potentiometers.
